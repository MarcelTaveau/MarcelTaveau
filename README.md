<h2>About Me</h2>
I am a full time student who enjoys pop music, video games, tech, and learning new things. Artists like Ariana Grande and Madison Beer inspire me with their creativity and incredible talent. I love diving into games like Minecraft, Wizard101, and Star Wars: The Old Republic for the creative gameplay and immersive stories. I am also fascinated by technologies like Virtual and Mixed Reality as creative and productivity frontiers. Curious by nature, I aim to blend my passions for music, video games, and tech into innovative and engaging experiences.
